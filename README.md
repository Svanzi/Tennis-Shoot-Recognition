Tennis shot recognition for a Deep Learning project.

Objectives:

- Extract body key point from a video
- Create a dataset for the 3 main shots in tennis (forehand, backhand, service) and neutral position
- Train a model predict and classify the shots in a video
- Use diffferent model (LSTM, GRU, Transformer) in order to compare the results and performances
